# Task 2  Simple Calculator Project
 CodSoft Python Programming Internship

Project Description

This is a Python-based Simple Calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project is created as part of the CodSoft Python Programming Internship to demonstrate fundamental Python programming concepts, including user input handling, conditional statements, and basic error handling.

Features

1. Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)



2. Error Handling:

Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric values).

Prevents division by zero.



3. User-Friendly Interface:

Simple prompts for easy input and operation selection.

Clear and concise output of results.



4. Reusable Design:

Loops allow multiple calculations in a single session.

How It Works

1. The user is prompted to:

Enter two numbers.

Choose an arithmetic operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).



2. The program calculates and displays the result.


3. After displaying the result, the user can choose to perform another calculation or exit.

How to Run the Project

1. Install Python: Ensure Python (version 3.6 or above) is installed on your system.
Download Python


2. Clone or Download the Repository:

git clone <repository-link>


3. Run the Script:
Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute the script:

python calculator.py

Sample Output

Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Choose an operation:
1: Addition (+)
2: Subtraction (-)
3: Multiplication (*)
4: Division (/)
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): 1

Result: 10 + 5 = 15

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no
Thank you for using the calculator. Goodbye!

Learning Outcomes

Python Fundamentals: Worked with input(), print(), and basic operations.

Conditionals and Loops: Used if-elif-else and while loops effectively.

Error Handling: Implemented exception handling (try-except) for input validation and division by zero.

Future Improvements

Add advanced operations (e.g., modulus, square root, power).

Include a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.

Save calculation history to a file for reference.
